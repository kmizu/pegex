 * Implementation of a nested reader.  A nested reader combines
 * several streams into a single stream.  It starts by reading from a
 * main stream.  Additional streams are added through the {@link
 * #insert(Reader)} and {@link
 * #insert(Reader,NestedReader.EOFListener)} methods and are consumed
 * completely before returning to read from the previous stream.  Note
 * that inserted streams are automatically closed after having being
 * consumed.  Further note that closing a nested reader closes all
 * streams currently associated with that nested reader.
