This directory contains Java files from ANTLR's, Cryptix', and Rats!'
source distributions.  They are used as inputs for experimental
evaluations.  Note that, even though the headers for Rats!' sources
say otherwise, the files licensed under the GPL are only licensed
under version 2 and the files licensed under the LGPL are only
licensed under version 2.1.

This directory also contains scripts for running Ella, an
Elkhound-generated parser, and for running an SDF2-generated parser.
See the glr directory for instructions on how to build the
corresponding parsers.
